# 📊 Portfolio Projects

Welcome to my portfolio!  
This repository is a collection of projects where I combine **data engineering, machine learning, and business intelligence** to deliver actionable insights and polished dashboards. Each project demonstrates my ability to build **end-to-end data pipelines**, apply **EDA and ML models**, and translate results into **clear, impactful visualizations**.

## 🚀 What You'll Find Here
- **Data Pipelines**: From raw CSV → SQL → Python EDA/ML → PostgreSQL integration → Power BI dashboards
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Statistical summaries, visualizations, and feature engineering
- **Machine Learning Models**: Classification, recommendation systems, and predictive analytics
- **Business Intelligence Dashboards**: Minimalist, KPI-focused Power BI dashboards for executive storytelling
- **Workflow Automation**: Scripts and templates for reproducible, scalable analysis

## 🎯 Purpose
This portfolio is designed to:
- Showcase my technical expertise in **Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, psycopg2, and Power BI**
- Demonstrate how I bridge **ML outputs with BI dashboards** for real-world decision-making
- Highlight my approach to **clarity, impact, and storytelling** in data projects

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn), SQL
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL
- **Visualization**: Power BI
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, DAX
